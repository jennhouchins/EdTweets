For this week's independent analysis assignment, I'm pulling tweets from
Twitter following Jason Lee's tutorial "Pulling Tweets into R" from

# Education Hashtags

I would like to know what people have been tweeting about education most
recently, particularly for our state, North Carolina. So, I focused my search on tweets that used the following hashtags:

1.  \#edchat (national level ed tweets)
2.  \#nced (NC state level ed tweets)

# How many tweets?

Searching Twitter resulted in <span style="color: #a23;"><b>6,912 tweets</b></span> that used the
hashtags of \#edchat or \#nced.

I asked for 5000 tweets for each hashtag as a search
term, but interestingly, <span style="color: #a23;"><b>\#nced</b></span> only returned <span style="color: #a23;"><b>1,912 </b></span> of
the results.

# 

```{r import-data, cache=TRUE, include=FALSE}
datafilePath <- "data/education_tweets.csv"
ed_tweets <- read_csv(datafilePath) %>%
  select(text, favoriteCount, created, retweetCount, isRetweet, tag, screenName, id) %>% 
 filter(tag != "onlinelearning")
```

Because pulling tweets can take some time, I pulled the data and saved
it to a csv that I've used to read selected columns in here.

Here's a glimpse:

```{r}
glimpse(ed_tweets)
```

# Tweet Frequency?

<small>Here is the frequency of education tweets since February 5th. The grey
dashed line shows where the new week begins on Monday and the red dashed line occurring at noon on February 10th shows where a flurry of tweeting began.</small>

```{r, out.width="60%"}
ts_plot(ed_tweets, "hours") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
       title = "Tweet Frequency",
       subtitle = paste0(format(min(ed_tweets$created), "%B %d, %Y"), " to ", format(max(ed_tweets$created),"%B %d, %Y")),
       caption = "\nData collected from Twitter's REST API via twitteR") +
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(NULL, NULL, color = "#a23000", size = 18, face = "bold")) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.POSIXct("2021-02-07 24:00:00", tz = "UTC"), linetype = 2, color = "grey") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.POSIXct("2021-02-10 12:00:00", tz = "UTC"), linetype = 2, color = "#a23000")
```

# So what happened?

Maybe the most retweeted tweet from NC on February 10th  will provide a clue...

<center>

```{r}
most_Retweets <- ed_tweets %>% 
  filter(tag == 'nced') %>% 
  arrange(-retweetCount) %>%
  slice(1) %>% 
  select(created, screenName, text, retweetCount, id)
#glimpse(most_Retweets)

library(tweetrmd)

tweetrmd::tweet_embed(tweet_url(most_Retweets$screenName, most_Retweets$id))
```

</center>

# 

<small> After filtering out retweets so the results would not be skewed, the most frequently used words in the education tweets are shown here. The results were filtered by words used more than 50 times. </small>

<small>Notice that the #edchat tweets seem to suggest discussions around edtech and education in general, but the #nced tweets suggest discussions that reflect state politics that affect education.</small>
```{r, include=FALSE}
tokenizable_tweets <- ed_tweets %>%
  filter(isRetweet == "FALSE") %>%
  select(text, tag)

tidy_tweets <- unnest_tokens(tokenizable_tweets, word, text)
ed_tweets_clean <- anti_join(tidy_tweets, stop_words)

custom_stop <- data.frame("word" = c("t.co", "https", "edchat", "nced", "onlinelearning"))

ed_tweets_clean_notags <- anti_join(ed_tweets_clean, custom_stop)

```

```{r, include=FALSE}
tweet_word_counts <- ed_tweets_clean_notags %>%
  count(tag, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(tag) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))

total_words <- tweet_word_counts %>%
  group_by(tag) %>%
  summarise(total = sum(n))

tweet_word_totals <- left_join(tweet_word_counts, total_words)

#tweet_word_totals
```

```{r, out.width="75%"}
# tweet_word_counts

tweet_word_totals %>%
  filter(n > 50) %>% # keep rows with word counts greater than 100
  group_by(tag) %>% 
  slice_max(proportion, n=5) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(tag = as.factor(tag), word = reorder_within(word, proportion, tag)) %>% #reorder the word variable by n and replace with new variable called word
  ggplot(aes(word, proportion, fill=tag)) + # create a plot with n on x axis and word on y axis
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) + # make it a bar plot
  facet_wrap(~tag, ncol = 3, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_x_reordered() 
```

# 

For a closer look at NC, this word cloud shows the top 75 most frequently used words in tweets that used the \#nced hashtag.

<center>

```{r, include=FALSE}
word_counts <- ed_tweets_clean_notags %>% 
  filter(tag == 'nced') %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  top_n(75)
```

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=5}
wordcloud2(word_counts, shape='circle')
```

</center>

# Reflecting

The analysis of education tweets suggest that recently the focus on education here in our state is on the pandemic and state politics. 

In particular, <span style="color: #a23;"><b>sb37</b></span> occurs quite frequently in the #nced tweets and refers to <span style="color: #a23;"><b>NC Senate Bill 37</b></span> entitled <span style="color: #a23;"><b>"In-Person Learning Choice for Families."</b></span>
